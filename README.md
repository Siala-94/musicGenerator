# Finetuning Transformer Models to Generate Lyrics

## Project Overview

This project explores the process of using transformer models to generate music lyrics. The focus is on selecting the appropriate model, configuring the model head for specialized tasks, and fine-tuning a general transformer model to generate meaningful and coherent lyrics. The project uses Facebook's BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) as the core model and fine-tunes it for the specific task of lyric generation based on user input.
